# Twister - An Introduction

Twister is a powerful jekyll theme. 

We don’t want to babble about how awesome jekyll is, since you already know that. In this documentation we will introduce you to the world of twister. A world in which you have all  the functionality you might have used in a previous WordPress blog or dreamt of when using Blogger. Additionally, it’s fast. Like really fast. Lightning kind of fast in comparison to some of those bloated sites, because it’s basically just static HTML. Fast, secure and really convenient, as there is no annoying WYSIWYG editor, that pretends to give you a sleek layout but actually is some really messed up code. My fellow HTML friends will know what I’m talking about. Jekyll posts are written in markdown. It feels natural and produces some pretty nice (and correct!) code.

Twister comes with a variety of different post types, which make it suitable for a lot of different sites. It is easy to use once you set up everything and all you have to do is write some markdown, run a max of three grunt commands and you are good to go.

Let us guide you through the basic set up.

Also make sure to scroll all the way till the end, as we’ve added some extra goodies for you to make creating posts even more of a breeze.
