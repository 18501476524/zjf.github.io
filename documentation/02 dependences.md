# Dependences

Jekyll is awesome, but it has quite a few requirements.

Before going on, you will need to install a few things. We’ll just link you to the docs, because they do a pretty good job, most of the time.

1. **Git**
   if you plan on using this theme on your own server and don’t like version control (we sincerely hope that is not the case, version control is awesome!) this is not required:
   [Installing Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
   You also wanna [sign up on GitHub](https://github.com/), if you want to host there. 
1. **Sass**
   Sass is the preprocessor of our choice. We write all of our stylesheets in it. Because it's fast, sassy and awesome!
   [Installing Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)
1. **Grunt**
   Grunt makes our life easier. We use it to serve our jekyll, minify and concatenate our javascript, compile our Sass, prefix the CSS and deploy the site to GitHub. "Making our life easier" not even closely describes how vital the job is, grunt carries out for us. You’ll see.

1. **jekyll**
   Of course, nothing could happen without the star of the show.
   [Installing jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

In order for Sass, grunt and jekyll to work you need [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), [**RubyGems**](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) as well as [**NodeJS**](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

For the liverefresh, you will need livereload for your browser of choice. ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/livereload/?src=userprofile) &bull; [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) if your browser of choice is something other than that: make a new choice, a better one (okay, [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/de/extensions/details/livereload-201-beta/?display=en) is allowed as well...))

Once you’ve mastered all of those installations, the rest will be a piece of cake.
