# Set Up

As soon as you have all of the dependences installed, you are ready to set up your site.

Create a new folder and copy our demo site into this folder. Open the folder in your favorite editor (ours is [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)) to check out the files and make the necessary changes.

Other than the editor you will need a browser and a terminal. Don't be scared, the terminal is here to help you.
