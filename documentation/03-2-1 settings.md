### Settings
In the following section weâ€™ll go over the variables settings.

First of all you want to set the `name` of your site, as well as the `description`, kinda like your tagline.

Then there are `url` and `baseurl`. The `url` is mostly just for the rss feed, so just add the url here for that. The `baseurl` is used only if you're site is in a subfolder. Then you want to add this folder name in the `baseurl`.
So as example, if your github username is `user` and the project this site lives in is called `project` you would fill the variables as follows (the address of the site would then be: http://user.github.io/project )

```yml
url: http://user.github.io
baseurl: /project
```

**Note**: if you set up a custom domain, you will need to adjust this setting to your custom domain, not the underlying GitHub address.
