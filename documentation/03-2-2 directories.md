### Directories
These variables handle the folder structure.

The `media_folder` is the place where all of the images are stored (featured images, galleries etc.) By default it’s `/img`, this is where the current media lives (all of the demo posts’ images etc.) if you want to change that, make sure this folder actually exists and your files are placed in the correct folder.

The other variables handle URLs. The folders in which tags, categories and author pages will be placed.

``` yml
tag_dir: /tag
category_dir: /category
author_dir: /author
media_folder: /img
```
