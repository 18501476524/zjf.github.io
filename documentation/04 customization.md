# Customization

Of course customizing is endless, especially since jekyll is HTML and not PHP and people like to fiddle with HTML a lot more. We love HTML for it's simplicity and always look forward to playing with it.

So yeah, we won't go too much into detail how much you can actually make twister look different, because we like the way we designed it. But still, changing colors and adjusting the logo obviously is something you might want to change, and of course we won't interfere with that.
