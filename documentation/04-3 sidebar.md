## Sidebar

The sidebar file might also be worth a quick glance.

It allows you to place whatever you want.

Widgets follow some simple rules to process basic markup in order that styles get applied correctly

The file you need is `_include/sidebar.html` and the HTML structure for a widget looks like this:

```html
<div class="widget">
    <h3 class="title">Widget Title</h3>
    <!-- your widget content -->
</div>
```

Place your title in the h3 tag and place your content underneath your title. You can include whatever HTML you like.
