### Standard &amp; Full-Width

For the pages you also use the classic jekyll front matter.

Here is what it looks like for one of our pages

```yml
---
layout: page
featimg: 6.jpg
title: Page
---
```

The `layout` options are again `full-width` or `with sidebar`.

The version without sidebar would require the layout-value `page_full`

The title is self-explanatory. Add a title  if you want your page to have like - a name (no anonymous pages out there guys, please!). You might want to make it relatable to the folder name as well. Just a tip.

The `featimg` variable is for the featured image. It will be added above the content (and title). The image has to be within the media folder defined in the `_config.yml`<sup>[[3.2.2](#dir)]</sup> file.

And then just go about adding your content underneath the front matter. And if it is just for writing, we highly recommend using markdown since itâ€™s much easier and more fun to write in markdown.
