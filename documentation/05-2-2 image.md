### Image
For an image post, the post type needs to be changed.

It looks just slightly different than the standard post. The featured image is above the content since that is the main part of an image post.

For the image post type, obviously `featimg` becomes a requirement.

Image post type front matter:

```yml
---
type: image
featimg: 3.jpg
author: someone
title: image post
description: describing the post
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
category: [category]
---
```
