# Additional Functionality

Jekyll is fantastic, but it comes with a few restrictions.

First and probably biggest of all is the lack of a comment function.

But it's not that bad, because there are possibilities to include comments. One of the most popular comment systems, is actually just embedded through HTML and that's the one we will use.

The other thing is a search function. If you don't feel the need that your users actually utilize this function just leave it out. If you think a search function is a necessity, there are different options you can use.
