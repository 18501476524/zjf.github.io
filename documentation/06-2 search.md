## Search function

When it comes to search functions, there are several different options and opinions. Some people don't like certain search functions, others love them, etc.

We did include a dummy search form, jut for design purposes, in case you want to include a search function.

There are possibilities floating around on the internet using javascript. Another option would be to create a Google custom search.

We don't set any rules or recommendations. It is totally up to you what you want to use.

Also, world of inter webs provides much better instructions on that matter than we could ever write.
