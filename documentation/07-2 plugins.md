## Plugins: Yes or No?

It is a decision, an endless back and forth. Or maybe not? 

If you want to have several people contributing on the site with plugins you will have to act as a moderator. So people can create posts on GitHub, but in order for the blog posts to go live, you will have to pull the changes, rebuild the site with grunt and push the live site back up with grunt deploy. If that is not a step you want to take, you might just sacrifice the plugins (no author pages, no category pages, no tag pages) and have new posts go live automatically.

There are a lot of pros and cons for every method, and the decision is personal. Even if you go without the plugins, the site will still have a lot of nice features. And the archive will still work.

After you've made a decision, you are ready to deploy.

If you decided to go with the plugins, skip the next section. If you go without plugins, skip the section after the next one.
