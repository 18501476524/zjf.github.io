# File Name and Front Matter Generator

And this is our little extra.

We know how tedious it can be to remember variable names. You wish you could just fill out some fields and have the front matter generated for you? You can have that!

We wrote a little generator, that does exactly that.

It comes in your folder and is called `file_name_and_front_matter_generator.html`

Open the file in your browser, fill the form out and the generator will output the file name, with the current date and the front matter that you then can just copy and paste into your next post.

Or use the one below, if you prefer.

<iframe src="file_name_and_front_matter_generator.html" height="900px"></iframe>

And now all that's left for us to say is: happy blogging!
